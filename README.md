    your telegram account may get banned.
    i am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
    this bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
    as well as efficiently managing groups.
    you ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    and you ended up in a finale battle with telegram and at the end
    telegram team deleted your account?
    and after that, then you pointed your fingers at me
    for getting your account deleted?
    i will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
